# Subliminal-Minimal-Gui

A simple Graphical User Interface for subliminal.
Made for downloading subtitles quickly from different providers in different languages.
Depends on python 2, subliminal and PyGObject.

If you are running a debian-like system, you might want to install dependencies with
sudo apt-get install python-gobject

Do not! use the debian package system for subliminal. this application only works with ; pip install subliminal
