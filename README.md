# Subliminal-Minimal-Gui

A simple Graphical User Interface for subliminal.
Made for downloading subtitles quickly from different providers in different languages.
Depends on python 2, subliminal and PyGObject.

If you are running a debian-like system, you might want to install dependencies with
sudo apt-get install python-gobject
sudo apt-get install python-subliminal
if the latter doesn't work, try just:
sudo apt-get install subliminal

If you are NOT running a debian system, try installing the dependencies with pip.
