# Subliminal-Minimal-Gui

#A simple Graphical User Interface for Subliminal.
##Made for downloading subtitles quickly from different providers in different languages.
Depends on python 2, subliminal, and PyGObject.
It's built in one script so you can easily add/remove languages/providers
###Comes with the following languages:
English, Esperanto, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Spanish.
**You can easily add your own languages by changing the script.**

##requierments,
Tested on many old machines and limited virtual machines and it's very fast.
runs in windows and linux. on most linux machines just download subliminal through pip and run my script. Windows machines need to install a pygobject & gtk3+/all-in-one installer.
You can download multiple subtitles by simply clicking on the download button as many times as you wish.


##ToDo,

download subtitles for a list of movies

*Do not! use the debian package system for subliminal. It seems the debian package currently is too old a version for this app. this application only works with subliminal from pypi ; pip install subliminal*
